Quizlit is a website designed for students by students. 
It includes multiple ways of learning including reading, flashcards and important vocab and tips for the test.

It loads all of its data off of a seperate json file to make it easier to quickly add, edit or delete future flashcard sets.

I am currently working on making the website look better and adding more entertaining elements. 

Some functions may be broken for short periods of time due to the fact that they are under development.
